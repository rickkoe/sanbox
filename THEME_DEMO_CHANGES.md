# Theme Demo Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Standalone Route
**Problem:** Theme demo was inside the main app layout with navbar/sidebar, causing scrolling issues.

**Solution:** Moved `/theme-demo` to be a top-level route (like `/login`) outside the main app layout.

**Changed Files:**
- `/frontend/src/App.js`
  - Added `<Route path="/theme-demo" element={<ThemeDemo />} />` at top level (line 278)
  - Removed duplicate route from inside AppContent
  - Imported ThemeDemo as a regular import (not lazy loaded)

### 2. Self-Contained Theme Provider
**Problem:** Theme demo relied on the app's ThemeProvider which wasn't available outside the main layout.

**Solution:** Wrapped ThemeDemo in its own ThemeProvider.

**Changed Files:**
- `/frontend/src/pages/ThemeDemo.js`
  - Imported ThemeProvider
  - Split into ThemeDemoContent (uses theme) and ThemeDemo (provides theme)
  - Added themes.css import

### 3. Fixed Scrolling
**Problem:** Multiple nested scroll containers caused scrolling issues.

**Solution:** Simplified scroll architecture with clear hierarchy.

**Changed Files:**
- `/frontend/src/styles/theme-demo.css`
  - `.theme-demo-root`: Changed to `height: 100vh` and `overflow: hidden`
  - `.theme-demo-content`: Keeps `overflow-y: auto` for scrolling
  - Added visual separator and header for table section

- `/frontend/src/components/theme-demo/SamplePage.css`
  - Removed `overflow-y: auto` from `.sample-page`
  - Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent collapsing

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Added "TanStack Table Example" header before the table
- Added border-top separator between component showcase and table
- Made sections more visually distinct

### 5. Button Color Updates
**Changed from green to blue for primary buttons:**

**Light Theme:**
- Primary: #0969da (GitHub blue)
- Hover: #0550ae

**Dark Theme:**
- Primary: #1f6feb
- Hover: #388bfd

**Dark+ Theme:**
- Primary: #388bfd
- Hover: #58a6ff

## How It Works Now

### Route Structure
```
App
├── /login (standalone)
├── /theme-demo (standalone) ← NEW
└── /* (main app with navbar/sidebar)
    ├── /
    ├── /customers
    ├── /san
    └── ...
```

### Component Hierarchy
```
ThemeDemo (provides ThemeProvider)
└── ThemeDemoContent (uses theme)
    └── .theme-demo-root (100vh container)
        ├── .theme-demo-switcher (theme selector)
        └── .theme-demo-layout (fills remaining space)
            ├── SampleNavbar
            └── .theme-demo-main
                ├── SampleSidebar
                └── .theme-demo-content (scrollable)
                    ├── SamplePage (component showcase)
                    └── .theme-demo-table-section
                        └── SampleTable
```

### Scroll Behavior
1. `.theme-demo-root` - Fixed 100vh height, no scroll
2. `.theme-demo-content` - Has `overflow-y: auto`, scrolls vertically
3. Content inside - Uses `flex-shrink: 0` to maintain size
4. User can scroll through all content smoothly

## Accessing Theme Demo

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/theme-demo`

**Features:**
- ✅ Completely standalone (no app navigation)
- ✅ Independent theme state
- ✅ Full viewport usage
- ✅ Smooth scrolling through all content
- ✅ Can switch themes without affecting main app
- ✅ Shows all components (navbar, sidebar, tables, forms, buttons, etc.)

---

## Testing

1. Start dev server: `./start`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/theme-demo`
3. Click theme buttons at top (Light / Dark / Dark+)
4. Scroll down to see:
   - Component showcase (SamplePage)
   - Divider line
   - "TanStack Table Example" heading
   - Full table with sorting, pagination, etc.
5. Verify all components update when switching themes

---

## Reverting to In-App Demo

If you want the theme demo back inside the main app:

1. Move the route back into AppContent in App.js
2. Remove ThemeProvider wrapper from ThemeDemo.js
3. Rely on app's existing ThemeProvider

But the standalone approach is recommended because:
- No navigation clutter
- Full screen for better comparison
- Independent theme state
- Easier to test themes without affecting work
- Can be opened in multiple tabs with different themes
