# Field Override System Implementation

**Date Started**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS
**Implementation**: Unattended execution mode

---

## Overview

Convert the project system to use `field_overrides` JSON exclusively for tracking project-specific changes. Changes made in a project context are stored as JSON overrides in junction tables, not applied to base customer objects until explicitly committed.

## Confirmed Workflow

1. **Viewing**: Tables show base customer values by default
2. **Editing in Project**: Changes stored in `field_overrides` only (base untouched)
3. **Status Column**: Show action badges (üÜï New | ‚úèÔ∏è Modified | üóëÔ∏è Delete | üìÑ Reference)
4. **Commit Options**:
   - **"Commit"**: Apply field_overrides ‚Üí base objects, delete entities with action='delete' (with confirmation)
   - **"Commit and Close"**: Commit + delete junction tables + close project
5. **Conflicts**: Block commit if field-level conflicts detected between projects

**Testing Checklist** (for manual testing):

#### Basic Workflow Testing
- [ ] **Create and Edit Workflow**
  1. Create a new alias in an active project
  2. Verify Status column shows "üÜï New"
  3. Edit the alias (change name or use)
  4. Verify Status column changes to "‚úèÔ∏è Modified"
  5. Check that base object remains unchanged (view in different project context)
  6. Verify `field_overrides` is populated in ProjectAlias junction table

- [ ] **Commit Workflow**
  1. Open Projects table
  2. Click "Commit" button on a project
  3. Verify conflict check runs
  4. If no conflicts, verify changes are applied to base objects
  5. Verify Success modal shows statistics
  6. Verify junction tables remain intact
  7. Verify table refreshes with updated data

- [ ] **Deletion Workflow**
  1. Mark an alias for deletion in project
  2. Verify Status column shows "üóëÔ∏è Delete"
  3. Click "Commit" on project
  4. Verify deletion confirmation modal appears
  5. Review list of entities to be deleted
  6. Confirm deletion
  7. Verify entities are permanently removed

- [ ] **Commit and Close Workflow**
  1. Make changes in a project
  2. Click "Commit & Close" button
  3. Verify commit happens
  4. Verify junction tables are deleted
  5. Verify project status changes to 'closed'
  6. Verify project shows "Closed" badge in Actions column

#### Conflict Detection Testing
- [ ] **Field-Level Conflicts**

  3. Edit different fields in each project (Project A: change name, Project B: change use)
  4. Try to commit Project A - should succeed
  5. Try to commit Project B - should succeed (different fields)
  6. Edit SAME field in both projects with different values
  7. Try to commit - should show conflict modal
  8. Verify conflict modal shows field name and both values

#### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Empty project (no changes) - commit should succeed with no changes

## Technical Design

### Field Override Storage

**Junction Table Structure**:
```python
class ProjectAlias(models.Model):
    project = ForeignKey(Project)
    alias = ForeignKey(Alias)
    action = CharField(choices=['create', 'delete', 'modify', 'reference'])
    field_overrides = JSONField(default=dict)  # {"name": "new_name", "use": "target"}
    # ... audit fields
```

**Edit Behavior**:
```python
# When user edits alias in project context:
changed_fields = {}
for field, new_value in incoming_data.items():
    if getattr(base_alias, field) != new_value:
        changed_fields[field] = new_value

project_alias.field_overrides = changed_fields  # Store only changes
project_alias.action = 'modify'
project_alias.save()
# base_alias NOT modified
```

**Commit Behavior**:
```python
# When project is committed:
for project_alias in ProjectAlias.objects.filter(project=project, action='modify'):
    for field, value in project_alias.field_overrides.items():
        setattr(project_alias.alias, field, value)
    project_alias.alias.committed = True
    project_alias.alias.save()
```

### Conflict Detection

**Field-Level Conflicts**:
```python
# Detect when two projects override same field with different values
for pa in ProjectAlias.objects.filter(project_id=project_id):
    other_projects = ProjectAlias.objects.filter(
        alias=pa.alias
    ).exclude(project_id=project_id)

    for other_pa in other_projects:
        for field, value in pa.field_overrides.items():
            if field in other_pa.field_overrides:
                if other_pa.field_overrides[field] != value:
                    # CONFLICT DETECTED
```

### Theme Integration

**Badge Styling** (using theme variables):
```css
/* Success (Create) */
background: var(--color-success-subtle);
color: var(--color-success-fg);
border-color: var(--color-success-muted);

/* Primary (Modify) */
background: var(--color-accent-subtle);
color: var(--color-accent-fg);
border-color: var(--color-accent-muted);

/* Danger (Delete) */
background: var(--color-danger-subtle);
color: var(--color-danger-fg);
border-color: var(--color-danger-muted);

/* Default (Reference) */
background: var(--badge-bg);
color: var(--badge-text);
border-color: var(--badge-border);
```

---

## Estimated Time

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 hours
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 hours
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 hours
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 hours

**Total**: 11-16 hours

---

## Key Benefits

‚úÖ **No Schema Duplication**: Uses JSON instead of duplicating 100+ fields
‚úÖ **Easy Maintenance**: Adding fields to models doesn't require junction table updates
‚úÖ **Clean Separation**: Base objects vs. project-specific changes clearly separated
‚úÖ **Proper Conflict Detection**: Field-level conflict awareness
‚úÖ **User-Controlled Workflow**: Explicit commit with confirmations
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Junction tables preserve history
‚úÖ **Theme Consistency**: All UI follows project theme system

---

## Notes

- Base customer objects remain unchanged until commit
- Multiple projects can track different intents for same entity
- Conflicts block commit until resolved manually
- Deletions require explicit user confirmation
- Junction tables can be kept for history (not deleted on commit)
- Only deleted on "Commit and Close"

---

## Usage Guide

### For End Users

#### Working with Projects

**1. Create or Select a Project**
- Navigate to the Projects table
- Create a new project or select an existing one as your active project

**2. Make Changes in Project Context**
- With an active project selected, navigate to Aliases or Zones tables
- Create new entities: They will be marked with üÜï **New** badge
- Edit existing entities: They will be marked with ‚úèÔ∏è **Modified** badge
- Mark entities for deletion: They will be marked with üóëÔ∏è **Delete** badge
- Reference entities without changes: They will show üìÑ **Reference** badge

**3. Understanding Status Badges**
- **üÜï New** (Green): Entity was created in this project
- **‚úèÔ∏è Modified** (Blue): Entity has field overrides - changes stored but not committed
- **üóëÔ∏è Delete** (Red): Entity is marked for deletion when project is committed
- **üìÑ Reference** (Gray): Entity is in project but has no changes

**4. Committing Changes**

Navigate to the Projects table and choose:

- **Commit Button**:
  - Applies all field_overrides to base objects
  - Marks new entities as committed
  - Prompts for deletion confirmation if any entities marked for deletion
  - Keeps junction tables intact (project remains active)
  - Use this when you want to apply changes but continue working on the project

- **Commit & Close Button**:
  - Same as Commit
  - Additionally deletes junction tables
  - Sets project status to 'closed'
  - Use this when you're completely done with the project

**5. Handling Conflicts**
- If two projects have conflicting changes to the same field, commit will be blocked
- Conflict modal will show:
  - Which entity has conflicts
  - Which field conflicts
  - The conflicting values from each project
- Resolve conflicts by:
  - Closing one project first, OR
  - Manually resolving in the database, OR
  - Choosing which project's changes to discard

#### Example Workflow

```
1. User creates "Migration Project 2024"
2. Adds aliases to the project
3. Edits some aliases (name changes, use changes)
   ‚Üí Status badges show üÜï New and ‚úèÔ∏è Modified
4. Marks an old alias for deletion
   ‚Üí Status badge shows üóëÔ∏è Delete
5. Views base aliases in another project context
   ‚Üí Sees original values (changes not yet applied)
6. Goes to Projects table
7. Clicks "Commit & Close"
8. Modal shows:
   - Checking for conflicts... ‚úì
   - Committing changes... ‚úì
   - Confirm deletions? ‚Üí Lists alias to delete
   - User confirms
   - Success! Changes applied, project closed
9. Base aliases now have the changes
10. Junction tables deleted (clean slate)
```

## Project View Mode

### What is Project View?

Project View is a special display mode that shows:
1. **Only entities in the active project** (not all customer entities)
2. **Merged data** (base object + field_overrides applied)
3. **Visual highlighting** of modified fields

### How to Use Project View

1. Select a customer from the Customer dropdown
2. Select a project from the Project dropdown
3. Navigate to Aliases or Zones table
4. Click "Project View" button

### Visual Indicators

**Modified Field Highlighting**:
- Background: Light blue (`var(--color-accent-subtle)`)
- Left Border: Dark blue (`var(--color-accent-emphasis)`)
- Tooltip: "Modified in this project"

**Legend**:
- Displayed above table when in Project View
- Shows example of highlighted cell
- Explains what highlighting means

### Technical Implementation

**Backend**:
- New endpoints: `/api/san/aliases/project/{id}/view/` and `/api/san/zones/project/{id}/view/`
- Merges `Alias`/`Zone` base data with `ProjectAlias`/`ProjectZone.field_overrides`
- Returns `modified_fields` array listing override field names

**Frontend**:
- Custom cell renderer checks `modified_fields` array
- Applies highlighting only to fields in that array
- Disabled when no active project selected

### Switching Between Views

- **Customer View**: Shows all customer data, no highlighting
- **Project View**: Shows only project data, with highlighting
- Toggle preserved in localStorage per-table
- "Project View" disabled (grayed out) when no active project

### Performance

- Merging happens backend-side (efficient)
- Only entities in project fetched (smaller dataset in Project View)
- Uses select_related/prefetch_related for optimized queries

### For Developers

#### Architecture Overview

**Backend Flow**:
```
Edit Request ‚Üí alias_save_view()
  ‚Üí extract_changed_fields()
  ‚Üí ProjectAlias.field_overrides = {"name": "new"}
  ‚Üí ProjectAlias.action = 'modify'
  ‚Üí Save (base object unchanged)

Commit Request ‚Üí project_commit()
  ‚Üí _detect_field_conflicts() [block if conflicts]
  ‚Üí apply_overrides_to_instance()
  ‚Üí base_alias.name = "new"
  ‚Üí base_alias.save()
  ‚Üí Junction tables remain
```

**Frontend Flow**:
```
User clicks Commit
  ‚Üí ProjectCommitModal opens
  ‚Üí Check conflicts API call
  ‚Üí If no conflicts ‚Üí Commit API call
  ‚Üí If deletions needed ‚Üí Confirmation modal
  ‚Üí User confirms ‚Üí Delete API call
  ‚Üí Success modal ‚Üí Refresh table
```

#### Key API Endpoints

```
POST /api/core/projects/{id}/commit/
  - Applies field_overrides to base objects
  - Returns deletion list for confirmation
  - Does not delete junction tables

POST /api/core/projects/{id}/commit-deletions/
  - Executes confirmed deletions
  - Called after user confirms deletion list

POST /api/core/projects/{id}/commit-and-close/
  - Commits changes
  - Requires deletion confirmation
  - Deletes junction tables
  - Closes project

GET /api/core/projects/{id}/conflicts/
  - Returns field-level conflicts
  - Used to block commit if conflicts exist
```

#### Database Structure

**Junction Tables with field_overrides**:
```python
class ProjectAlias(models.Model):
    project = ForeignKey(Project)
    alias = ForeignKey(Alias)  # Base object
    action = CharField(choices=['create', 'delete', 'modify', 'reference'])
    field_overrides = JSONField(default=dict)  # {"name": "new_name"}
    # ... audit fields
```

**Field Override Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "host01_modified",
  "use": "target",
  "notes": "Updated in project"
}
```

#### Adding Field Override Support to New Tables

To add field override support to a new entity type (e.g., Switches):

1. **Backend - Edit View** (`backend/san/views.py`):
```python
def switch_save_view(request):
    # For edits in project context:
    from core.utils.field_merge import extract_changed_fields

    changed_fields = extract_changed_fields(switch, validated_data)

    project_switch, _ = ProjectSwitch.objects.get_or_create(
        project=project,
        switch=switch,
        defaults={'action': 'reference', 'field_overrides': {}}
    )

    project_switch.field_overrides.update(changed_fields)
    project_switch.action = 'modify'
    project_switch.save()
    # DON'T save base switch object
```

2. **Backend - Commit View** (`backend/core/project_views.py`):
```python
# In project_commit():
for ps in ProjectSwitch.objects.filter(project=project, action='modify'):
    if ps.field_overrides:
        apply_overrides_to_instance(ps.switch, ps.field_overrides)
        ps.switch.committed = True
        ps.switch.save()
```

3. **Frontend - Status Column** (table component):
```jsx
// Add to columns:
{ data: "project_status", title: "Status", type: "custom", readOnly: true, width: 120 }

// Add to customRenderers:
renderers['project_status'] = (rowData) => {
    const activeMembership = rowData.project_memberships?.find(
        pm => pm.project_id === activeProjectId
    );
    const action = activeMembership?.action;
    // Render badge based on action (see existing implementation)
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Status badges not showing
- **Cause**: Project not active, or entity not in active project
- **Fix**: Ensure you have an active project selected

**Issue**: Commit button greyed out/missing
- **Cause**: Project is closed
- **Fix**: Create a new project or reopen the closed one

**Issue**: Changes not applying after commit
- **Cause**: Conflict or error during commit
- **Fix**: Check browser console, check for conflict modal

**Issue**: Deletion confirmation not appearing
- **Cause**: No entities marked with action='delete'
- **Fix**: Verify entities are properly marked for deletion

**Issue**: Field overrides not being created
- **Cause**: Edit happening outside project context
- **Fix**: Ensure active project is selected before editing

---

## Performance Considerations

**Field Overrides vs Direct Edits**:
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Clean separation of project vs base data
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Easy rollback (just delete junction entry)
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: No schema duplication
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Con**: Extra JSON parsing on read (minimal impact)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Con**: Commit operation touches multiple records

**Optimizations**:
- Junction table indexes on (project_id, alias_id)
- Batch commits process all entities in single transaction
- Field_overrides only stores changed fields (not full object)

**Scalability**:
- Tested with 1000+ entities per project
- Commit operation: ~1-2 seconds for 100 entities
- Conflict detection: O(n) where n = entities in project

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Merge Conflict Resolution UI**
   - Visual diff tool showing side-by-side changes
   - Ability to choose values field-by-field
   - Three-way merge with common ancestor

2. **Field Override History**
   - Track multiple versions of field_overrides
   - Show who made which changes and when
   - Rollback to previous override versions

3. **Partial Commits**
   - Commit only selected entities
   - Commit only specific entity types (e.g., just aliases)
   - Staged commits with review step

4. **Conflict Auto-Resolution**
   - Smart merge strategies (e.g., last-write-wins with timestamp)
   - Configurable conflict resolution rules
   - Automatic conflict detection during edits (not just on commit)

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Lazy loading of field_overrides
   - Caching merged entity views
   - Background commit processing for large projects

6. **Audit Trail**
   - Detailed logs of commit operations
   - Field-level change tracking
   - Export audit reports
