## Testing the MVP

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   ./start  # or ./dev-up.sh
   ```

2. **Access Worksheet Generator**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click Tools → Worksheet Generator

3. **Test Workflow**
   - Enter "Test Customer" as customer name
   - Enter "Test Project" as project name
   - Click "SAN Switch - Cisco" card
   - Fill in switch details
   - Click "Generate Worksheet"
   - Verify Excel file downloads
   - Open Excel file and verify:
     - Logo placeholder present
     - Project info correct
     - Equipment details populated
     - Professional formatting

4. **Test Multiple Equipment**
   - Select multiple equipment types
   - Add multiple items for one type
   - Generate and verify all appear in worksheet

5. **Test Form Validation**
   - Try generating with empty customer name (should show error)
   - Try generating with no equipment selected (should show error)

---

## Known Limitations (MVP)

1. ❌ No logo upload (placeholder only)
2. ❌ No contact selector (placeholder in generated file)
3. ❌ No template save/load functionality
4. ❌ No prefill from active customer/project
5. ❌ No worksheet preview before generation
6. ❌ No multi-step wizard
7. ❌ No bulk import
8. ❌ No worksheet history

These features are planned for future enhancement phases as documented in `WORKSHEET_GENERATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (High Priority)
- Multi-step wizard for better UX
- Contact selector with create/select functionality
- Prefill customer/project from active config
- Template save/load for reusability

### Phase 3 (Medium Priority)
- Logo upload and embedding
- Worksheet preview
- Custom branding (colors, footer text)
- Worksheet history tracking

### Phase 4 (Nice to Have)
- Bulk equipment import from CSV/Excel
- PDF export option
- Email worksheet functionality
- Share worksheets with team members

See [WORKSHEET_GENERATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md](/Users/rickk/sanbox/WORKSHEET_GENERATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for complete roadmap.

## Adding New Equipment Types

### Via Django Admin
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Go to **Core → Equipment Types**
3. Click **Add Equipment Type**
4. Fill in:
   - Name (e.g., "Backup Appliance")
   - Category (storage/network/compute/backup/other)
   - Vendor (optional)
   - Icon Name (from react-icons, e.g., "FaDatabase")
   - Display Order (sorting)
   - Fields Schema (JSON):
   ```json
   [
     {"name": "device_name", "label": "Device Name", "type": "text", "required": true},
     {"name": "ip_address", "label": "IP Address", "type": "text", "required": true},
     {"name": "model", "label": "Model", "type": "select", "required": false,
      "options": ["Model A", "Model B", "Model C"]}
   ]
   ```
5. Save - Equipment type immediately available in UI

### Via Seed Command
Edit `backend/core/management/commands/seed_equipment_types.py` and add your equipment type to the list, then run:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend python manage.py seed_equipment_types
```

## API Usage Examples

### Get Equipment Types
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/core/equipment-types/
```

### Generate Worksheet
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/core/worksheet-templates/generate_worksheet/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_name": "Acme Corp",
    "project_name": "Data Center Migration",
    "contact": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@acme.com",
      "phone": "555-1234",
      "title": "IT Manager"
    },
    "equipment": [
      {
        "type_id": 1,
        "type_name": "SAN Switch - Cisco",
        "quantity": 2,
        "items": [
          {
            "switch_name": "SW01",
            "management_ip": "10.0.0.1",
            "serial_number": "ABC123",
            "model": "MDS 9396"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }' \
  --output worksheet.xlsx
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page not loading
- Check that containers are running: `./status`
- Check frontend logs: `./logs frontend`
- Ensure route is added to App.js

### Issue: Equipment types not showing
- Run seed command: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend python manage.py seed_equipment_types`
- Check backend logs: `./logs backend`
- Verify API endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/core/equipment-types/

### Issue: Excel file not generating
- Check backend logs for errors
- Ensure openpyxl is installed: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec backend pip list | grep openpyxl`
- Verify payload in browser developer console

### Issue: Excel file formatting looks wrong
- Open file in Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice (not Google Sheets for best results)
- Check that openpyxl version matches: 3.1.5

---

## Production Deployment

### Before Deploying
1. Ensure requirements.txt includes openpyxl
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Run seed command: `python manage.py seed_equipment_types`
4. Test generation works in staging

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build production container
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build

# 2. Run migrations
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml exec backend python manage.py migrate

# 3. Seed equipment types
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml exec backend python manage.py seed_equipment_types

# 4. Restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml restart
```
