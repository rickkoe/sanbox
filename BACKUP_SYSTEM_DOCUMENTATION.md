## How to Use

### Via Frontend GUI
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/backups
2. Click "Create Backup"
3. Choose options (name, description, include media)
4. Monitor progress (auto-refreshes every 2 seconds)
5. Restore/Download/Delete as needed

### Via Django Admin
http://localhost:8000/admin/backup/

### Via API (curl examples)
```bash
# Create backup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/backup/backups/create/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Pre-deployment backup", "include_media": false}'

# List backups
curl http://localhost:8000/api/backup/backups/

# Restore backup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/backup/backups/1/restore/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"restore_media": true, "run_migrations": true}'
```

---

## Schema Version Compatibility

### How It Works
1. **At Backup Time**: System captures the migration state for all Django apps
2. **At Restore Time**: System compares backup migrations vs. current code migrations
3. **Automatic Handling**:
   - ✅ Exact match: Restore proceeds normally
   - ✅ Backup older than code: Runs forward migrations automatically
   - ⚠️ Backup newer than code: Warns user (code needs to be updated/rolled back)

### Migration Tracking
- Stores `django_migrations` table state in backup metadata
- Tracks migration IDs for: backup, customers, san, storage, importer, core, authentication
- Generates migration plan before restore
- Displays compatibility warnings if schema mismatch detected

### Cannot Rollback Migrations
Django doesn't support automatic rollback of migrations. If restoring from a newer backup to older code:
- System will WARN the user
- User must manually rollback code version OR
- Run migrations backward manually (advanced)

## Backup Contents

### Database Backup (pg_dump)
- Format: Custom (PostgreSQL custom format)
- Compression: Level 6 (configurable)
- Includes:
  - All table data
  - Schema definitions
  - Sequences, indexes, constraints
  - Functions, triggers, views

### Metadata JSON (stored in database)
```json
{
  "name": "Backup name",
  "django_version": "5.1.6",
  "python_version": "3.13",
  "postgres_version": "PostgreSQL 16",
  "app_version": "v1.2.3",
  "migration_state": {
    "backup": ["0001_initial"],
    "customers": ["0001_initial", "0002_add_fields"],
    ...
  },
  "installed_apps": ["django.contrib.admin", ...],
  "database_size": 52428800,
  "table_counts": {
    "customers_customer": 150,
    "san_fabric": 45,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Media Files (optional)
- Format: tar.gz archive
- Location: Stored separately from database backup
- Size tracked independently

---

## Configuration Options

### Storage Settings
- `backup_directory`: Where backups are stored (default: `/app/backups`)
- `max_backups`: Maximum number to retain (0 = unlimited)
- `retention_days`: Auto-delete older than N days (0 = keep all)
- `use_compression`: Compress backups (recommended: True)

### Automatic Backups
- `auto_backup_enabled`: Enable scheduled backups
- `auto_backup_hour`: Hour of day to run (0-23, server time)
- `auto_backup_include_media`: Include media in auto backups

### Retention Policy
Both `max_backups` and `retention_days` are enforced:
- Keeps only N most recent backups
- Deletes backups older than N days
- Runs after each backup creation

---

## Safety Features

### Pre-Restore Safety Backup
Before ANY restore operation:
1. System automatically creates a backup of current database
2. Labeled as "Pre-restore safety backup"
3. If restore fails, you can restore from this safety backup

### Checksum Verification
- SHA256 checksum calculated at backup time
- Verified before restore
- Prevents restoring corrupted backups

### File Integrity Check
- `pg_restore --list` command tests if backup file is readable
- Runs during backup verification

### Restore Validation
Before restore:
- Checks if backup file exists
- Verifies checksum matches
- Checks schema compatibility
- Shows migration plan
- Requires user confirmation

---

## File Locations

### Development
- Backups: `/Users/rickk/sanbox/dev_backups/` (on host)
- Mounted to: `/app/backups` (in container)
- Logs: `/Users/rickk/sanbox/dev_logs/`

### Production
- Backups: Docker volume `backup_files`
- Maps to: `/app/backups` (in container)
- Persistent across container restarts
- Can be backed up separately

### Backup File Naming
```
sanbox_backup_20251023_140230.dump         # Database
sanbox_media_20251023_140230.tar.gz        # Media (if included)
```

## Testing the System

### Quick Test (Development)
```bash
# 1. Start containers
./start

# 2. Create a test backup
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/backup/backups/create/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Backup"}'

# 3. Check backup was created
ls -lh /Users/rickk/sanbox/dev_backups/

# 4. View backups in browser
open http://localhost:3000/admin/backups
```

### Verify Backup Integrity
```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/backup/backups/1/verify/

# Via Django shell
./shell
>>> from backup.models import BackupRecord
>>> from backup.service import BackupService
>>> backup = BackupRecord.objects.first()
>>> service = BackupService(backup)
>>> service.verify_backup()
```

### Test Restore
1. Create backup
2. Make changes to database (add/delete records)
3. Restore from backup
4. Verify data is restored

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backup Fails
- Check disk space: `df -h /app/backups`
- Check PostgreSQL connection
- View logs in Django admin or via API
- Check Celery worker is running: `docker logs sanbox_dev_celery_worker`

### Restore Fails
- Check backup file exists and has correct permissions
- Verify checksum matches
- Check PostgreSQL credentials
- Look for schema compatibility warnings
- Check Celery worker logs

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix backup directory permissions
chmod 755 /Users/rickk/sanbox/dev_backups/
chown -R $(whoami) /Users/rickk/sanbox/dev_backups/
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test PostgreSQL connection
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec postgres \
  psql -U sanbox_dev -d sanbox_dev -c "SELECT version();"
```

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying
- [ ] Create full backup of production database
- [ ] Test backup/restore on staging environment
- [ ] Configure backup retention policy
- [ ] Set up backup directory with adequate disk space
- [ ] Enable automatic scheduled backups
- [ ] Test restore from backup on staging
- [ ] Document restore procedures for team

### After Deploying
- [ ] Verify first backup runs successfully
- [ ] Check backup file is created and has correct size
- [ ] Verify backup directory permissions
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting for failed backups
- [ ] Schedule regular restore tests
- [ ] Document backup location for disaster recovery

### Recommended Settings (Production)
```python
backup_directory = "/app/backups"          # Or mount to external storage
max_backups = 10                           # Keep 10 most recent
retention_days = 30                        # Delete older than 30 days
auto_backup_enabled = True                 # Enable automatic backups
auto_backup_hour = 2                       # 2 AM server time
auto_backup_include_media = False          # Backup media separately
use_compression = True                     # Always compress
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Security
- ✅ CSRF protection on API endpoints
- ✅ Authentication required (when implemented)
- ✅ Checksum verification prevents tampering
- ✅ Pre-restore safety backups
- ✅ File permissions restricted to app user

### Security Recommendations
1. **Encrypt backup files** - Add encryption in next phase
2. **Secure backup storage** - Use encrypted volumes/remote storage
3. **Access control** - Limit who can create/restore backups
4. **Audit logging** - Track all backup operations
5. **Network security** - Use HTTPS for downloads
6. **Secrets management** - Don't backup sensitive credentials
7. **Offsite backups** - Store copies in different location
