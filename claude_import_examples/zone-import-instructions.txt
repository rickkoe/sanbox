I want to build a new component from scratch for importing data into the database/tables of this app.  Currently, there is a functional BulkZoningImportPage for importing aliases and zones into a fabric that only works for Cisco aliases.  I want to have this same functionality in the new component, but I want you to look at the example files/data that I want it to be able to handle and have you come up with the most efficient and effective way to parse and import the data.  We will start by just importing SAN Alias and Zones, but eventually, it needs to be able to handle parsing an importing things like volumes, hosts, ports, etc for storage systems as well as future ready for eventual handling of IBM Power servers (not implemented in this app yet.). Also, I'm wondering if this component could handle the Storage Insights imports that are currently being done by the StorageInsightsImporter.  That importer is super slow and not very granular or featured yet in what it can pull in from IBM storage insights.  If you can read about the IBM Storage Insights REST API and build out that part as well so that imports will run much faster and have awareness of all the available options to import with the API.  Perhaps the backend of that importer needs some work too?

For examples of data to import, please see the folder
