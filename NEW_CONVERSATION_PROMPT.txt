PROMPT FOR NEW CONVERSATION
============================

Copy and paste this into a new Claude Code conversation:

I need you to implement a dual-dropdown context system and project view mode for my application.

Please read the complete implementation guide at:
/Users/rickk/sanbox/DUAL_DROPDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION.md

This document contains:
- All requirements and user answers to clarifying questions
- Complete code snippets ready to implement
- Exact file locations and line numbers
- 5 phases of implementation (12-16 hours estimated)
- Testing checklist
- Documentation updates

Key requirements summary:
1. Replace single customer/project dropdown with TWO separate dropdowns
2. Allow selecting customer WITHOUT requiring a project
3. Add "Project View" mode that shows ONLY project entities with field_overrides applied
4. Highlight modified cells (fields with overrides) using background color
5. Auto-clear project when switching customers
6. Add "+ Create New" options to both dropdowns

Please implement this phase-by-phase following the guide. After each phase:
- Show me what you've completed
- Test the changes
- Mark the phase as complete
- Move to next phase

Start with Phase 1 (Backend Changes) and proceed unattended through all phases unless you encounter issues.

CONTEXT:
- Application: Django backend + React frontend
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Already implemented: Field override system (see FIELD_OVERRIDE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- Active project: Customer has projects, projects have junction tables (ProjectAlias, ProjectZone, etc.)
- Junction tables have field_overrides JSONField for tracking project-specific changes

Ready to begin?
